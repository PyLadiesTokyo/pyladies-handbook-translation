# Checklist


Here’s all of what needs to be done to start a PyLadies group locally. 


You may of course adapt this list to meet your group’s needs.


## PART 1


- If you need, find some co-organizers to help with organization and planning.  


- Decide the namespace of your group (e.g. `portland.pyladies.com` or `pdx.pyladies.com`, same with email addresses).


- Fill out the [initial PyLadies group interest form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/18GjETzcU1KeqdrOMASeyCCNyl_wvWKpunUauLt6opS8/viewform) to get your namespace setup for your group domain and email.


Once you have received a confirmation that the the initial PyLadies request form was approved and setup, continue on:


## PART 2


- Sign up for Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and/or any social network that would be effective in your location. 


    We suggest to use your @pyladies.com email.


- Start up a Meetup.com group for your location. 


    Tip: Uber-frugal? Get half-price Meetup fees! 


    Complete all of the Meetup forms, but stop when you reach the payment page. 
    
    
    In 24 hours, you will receive an e-mail from Meetup.com, with a link to complete the payment process at half price. :)


- File for a reimbursement for Meetup fees to the Python Software Foundation by following [their grant process](https://www.python.org/psf/grants).


- Sign up for a Heroku account (free) if you have not already.


- Fill out the [PyLadies resource form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1f1jCD_XOf-06ifZkuSvAdCG9_Me0FnDWNxLQZY-JktU/viewform) for contact information, all group information, etc.


- Request to join the [PyLadies Global Organizers list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/pyladies-group-organizers).


- At minimum, try to hold one event a month -- this helps keep interest in PyLadies from flagging, and helps people maintain their progress in becoming better developers. 
    
    
    You can hold more events with proper support and planning.


- Promote the start of the group via various local channels, including meetup.com, local PUGs, related groups, and universities.
