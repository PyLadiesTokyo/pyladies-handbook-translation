# How to Report
   
   
We suggest that your report have two key things:    
    
    
1. a clear description of the harassment    
    
    
2. a statement of what it is you want the contact to do about the harassment    
    
    
This makes it less likely that they will not understand, or pretend to not understand, that you want action taken.     
    
    
It also creates some evidence that they were asked to act, so that they cannot claim later that there was no specific thing they were supposed to do.    
    
    
Occasionally also someone is under specific instructions to not do anything about complaints without a specific call to action.    
    
    
Other useful things to include:    
    
    
1. evidence, such as copies of harassing emails or letters, dates of phone calls or in-person actions    
    
    
You may wish to store both copies/records of harassing contact and of complaints you made.
