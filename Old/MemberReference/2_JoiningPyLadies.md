# Joining PyLadies
    
    
Want to join PyLadies? Fantastic! But I hate to break it to you, you already are one ;-).    
    
    
## Finding your local PyLadies
    
    
We (try to) maintain a list of PyLadies locations, but it may not be complete or up-to-date as every location is reponsible for updating & maintaining their location’s information.    
    
    
### Note
    
    
```text
If you believe that there is a location not shown on our [locations](http://www.pyladies.com/locations) page, please feel free to ping the organizer (if you know them), file an issue or submit a pull request with the relevant information!    
```

Once you find your location, go ahead and join their Meetup.com group (if they have one), and join/follow any social media accounts they have.    
    
    
## Remote PyLadies
    
    
We can’t be everywhere.    
    
    
But we’re trying! For those who do not have a PyLadies group within a reasonable distance (or even if you do!) we have an online PyLadies group called Remote PyLadies!     
    
    
Events are held by local organizers through online streaming/coding/etc tools and posted on the [Remote PyLadies](http://remote.pyladies.com/) site.    
     
    
## Want to volunteer?
    
    
Often times, our organizers - both local & remote - need help.     
    
    
Whether it’s mentorship for events, logistic help (e.g. a door woman).     
    
    
Don’t be shy in reaching out to them!    
    
    
Their contact information should be listed on our locations page.     
    
    
But if you’re having trouble, please feel free to [ping us](info%40pyladies.com) for introductions.
