# Process Checklist


Here’s all of what needs to be done to start a PyLadies group locally. 


You may of course adapt this list to meet your group’s needs.


## PART 1


Fill out the [initial PyLadies group interest form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeOL0xgRD6jwV3RJxFNApdT_qQN1-3uNomRK4XTfUKSaeDhNg/viewform) to get your namespace setup for your group domain and email. 


If you haven’t heard anything within a week, please [ping us](info%40pyladies.com)!


Once you have received a confirmation that the the initial PyLadies request form was approved and setup, continue on:


## PART 2


1.With the new `@pyladies.com` email address, sign up for the following social media/communications accounts (if it makes sense for your local group):


    1.Twitter
    2.Facebook
    3.Google+
    4.GitHub
    5.IRC/Freenode


2.Whether it’s Meetup.com or another local event/community site, start the local group with the `pyladies.com` email address.


**Note**


TIP! Uber-frugal? Get half-price Meetup fees! 


Complete all of the Meetup forms, but stop when you reach the payment page. 


In 24 hours, you will receive an e-mail from Meetup.com, with a link to complete the payment process at half price. :)


3.File for a reimbursement for Meetup fees to the Python Software Foundation by following [their grant process](https://www.python.org/psf/grants). 


A sample grant request can be found [here](http://kit.pyladies.com/en/latest/organizer/grants/sample-meetup-proposal.html).


**Note**


The Python Software Foundation will reimburse Meetup.com fees for PyLadies Meetup groups. 


However, if your location does not use Meetup.com but a different/similar site that charges, still file a reimbursement!


4.Sign up for a Heroku account with your `pyladies.com` email address. 


This will be used to setup your website, which is documented at [Creating your own Local Website](http://kit.pyladies.com/en/latest/organizer/website/local.html) once you’re ready.


5.Fill out the [PyLadies resource form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeL2c2zvlNANjPHN-slrZ-jIKkr556GM_268mtIKsdtUz9bGQ/viewform) for contact information, all group information, etc. 


This is for administrative purposes (e.g. what social media accounts do we own, where should we send PyLadies stickers to, etc), and will not ever be shared outside of PyLadies.


6.Request to join the following mailing lists:


    1.[PyLadies Global Organizers list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pyladies-group-organizers) - all global organizational communication and coordination is done via this list. 
    
    
    You’ll be introduced to the mailing list.


    2.[PyLadies Global Members list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pyladies) - a global list for PyLadies (and PyGent allies) members. 
    
    
    Feel free to introduce yourself and the new location.


7.If you’re familiar with IRC, come hang out in the #pyladies channel on Freenode.


8.Plan your first event! Check out [New Organizer Reference](http://kit.pyladies.com/en/latest/organizer/neworganizer.html) for New Organizer information. 


Start promoting your new group via various local channels, including meetup.com, local PUGs, related groups, and universities, as well as the global PyLadies Members list!
