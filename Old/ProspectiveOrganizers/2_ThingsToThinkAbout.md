# Things to Think About


## Types of Local Groups


A local group can be:


a geographic group: for a city, region, state, or country


a student group: for a university, college, or school


an interest group: for any topic (e.g. PyGame, SciPy, Django)


The larger the local group, the harder it is to meet in person. Large local group’s events will be mostly virtual meetups that occur online, whereas small local group’s events tend to be in-person meetups.


A local group can consist of sub-local-groups, making both the in-person and virtual meetups possible.


## Group Size


It’s fine if your local group is small. 


Having just 2-3 women who meet regularly to exchange Python tips and tricks counts as a local group. 


What matters most is quality, not quantity.


Larger local groups have more flexibility to organize different types of events, but it’s harder to get everyone together for dinner.


## Event Frequency


There are no formal requirements for how often a leader hold events.


However, we highly encourage that - at minimum, to try and hold one event a month. 


This helps keep interest in PyLadies from flagging, and helps people maintain their progress in becoming better developers. 


You can hold more events with proper support and planning.
