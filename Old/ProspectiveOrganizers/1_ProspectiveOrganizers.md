# Prospective Organizers


So you’ve decided to start your own PyLadies group – YAY!


We’re excited to have people like you join our growing community and want to help you get your group launched as quickly and painlessly as possible.


If our experience is any indication, your first major event will galvanize and inspire the Python community in your area and create momentum for subsequent events, so it’s crucial to start things off on the right foot!


To help you get started, we’ve created this open-source kit for starting your own PyLadies group in your city. 


PyLadies is part social club, part stepping stone toward the Python open-source world.
