## Purpose
Their are a few purposes of this PyLadies kit:    
    
    
1. To help those interested in starting their own local PyLadies    
    
    
2. To be a guide for current local organizers    
    
    
3. To be a guide for members    
    
    
Currently, you can pip install pyladies (see pip install pyladies) with limited functionality.     
    
    
But we plan on more awesome tools for the PyLadies package.
