# Other Avenues
    
    
PyLadies can only do so much, but there are other people and avenues to talk to where PyLadies may fall short.     
    
    
We also encourage our leaders to reach out to our contacts (e.g. an event host) to work towards making a better environment for our event space.    
   
   
## Employer
    
    
If the harrasser is an employee of a PyLadies venue host or sponsor, please feel comfortable in reaching out to their employer.     
    
    
You might consider reporting to the harasser’s employer if:    
    
    
- you are being harassed using company resources, such as from a work email address, fax machine or telephone number
    
    
- the harasser claims that their actions were encouraged by their employer, such as being a marketing ploy or a customer outreach activity
    
    
- you are being harassed by someone acting as a representative of their company, such as someone who is attending an event and wearing badges or distributing business cards with the company’s name on it or soliciting business for the company
    
    
- you are being harassed privately by someone whose job requires them to maintain good public standing or who wields a great deal of authority in their job, such as an employee of a feminist organisation, a politician, a police officer, a doctor or a lawyer. For many professions you may be able to look up their professional ethics standard and find out if their behaviour outside of work is governed by their professional affiliation.
    
    
Possible actions to request:    
   
   
- tell me whether or not the actions of `<HARASSER>` were authorised or approved by your organisation
    
    
- confirm whether or not `<COMPANY>` has policy that prohibits `<HARASSER>`‘s behavior
    
    
- confirm for me that you will speak with `<HARASSER>` and make it clear to them that their behaviour is unacceptable and must stop immediately
    
    
- immediately provide me with a new contact/account manager at `<COMPANY>`, as I cannot do business with `<HARASSER>` any longer
    
    
- terminate my account with `<COMPANY>` effective immediately (obviously, this will depend on contracts you have in place)
    
    
- do not allow `<HARASSER>` to represent `<COMPANY>` in this capacity again as `<HARASSER>` is harming your company’s image
    
    
- re-consider `<HARASSER>`‘s employment with your company
    
    
- assist me in referring `<HARASSER>`‘s actions to law enforcement
    
    
## Professional Body
    
    
This might be, for example, a medical registration board, or the bar organisation for lawyers.     
    
    
You might consider this if your harasser is an individual who has a professional membership that governs their private behaviour.     
    
    
You may possibly also do this if your harasser is about to join such a profession (eg. they are a medical student).    
     
     
Possible actions to request:    
    
    
- confirm whether or not `<HARASSER>`‘s behaviour violates your ethical code
    
    
- confirm for me that you will sanction `<HARASSER>` according to your profession’s standards (you might make specific reference to their ethics code if you have read them)
    
    
- open disciplinary proceedings against `<HARASSER>` to consider their deregistration from `<PROFESSION>`
    
    
- do not allow `<HARASSER>` to register as a practising member of `<PROFESSION>`
    
    
- assist me in referring `<HARASSER>`‘s actions to law enforcement
    
    
## Educational Institution
    
    
Much as in the case of an employer, in some circumstances you might choose not to involve an educational institution in a student’s external activities.    
    
    
But again there are some circumstances where you might consider it:    
    
    
- you are being harassed using institutional resources, such as a institutional email address, fax machine or telephone number
    
    
- the harasser claims that their actions were encouraged by their institution, such as claiming that the actions are part of a research study or project for assessment
    
    
- you are being harassed by someone acting as a representative of their institution, such as someone attending or speaking at a conference in their role as a researcher
     
     
Possible actions to request:    
    
    
- tell me whether or not the actions of `<HARASSER>` were authorised or approved by your organisation
    
    
- confirm whether or not `<HARASSER>` has ethics approval for this research [or assessment]
    
    
- give me the contact details of the project’s chief investigator [or the course’s teacher] and `<INSTITUTION>`‘s ethics review board so that I can ask that `<HARASSER>`‘s project be reviewed
    
    
- confirm whether or not `<INSTITUTION>` has policy that prohibits `<HARASSER>`‘s behaviour
    
    
- confirm for me that you will speak with `<HARASSER>` and make it clear to them that their behaviour is unacceptable and must stop immediately
    
    
- do not allow `<HARASSER>` to represent `<INSTITUTION>` in this capacity again as `<HARASSER>` is harming your institution’s image
    
    
- re-consider `<HARASSER>`‘s enrolment with your institution
    
    
- assist me in referring `<HARASSER>`‘s actions to law enforcement
    
    
## Internet Service Provider
    
    
In the case where the harassment is occurring online service, you may be able to trace the harasser via email address or IP address to a particular ISP.    
    
    
ISPs typically do not heavily police the actions of their users and may refuse to assist you unless law enforcement is also involved, but at the very least, you have a recorded complaint that may be useful if the person’s behaviour is systemic.    
    
    
Possible actions to request    
    
    
- tell `<HARASSER>` to stop using this service to harass people
    
    
- monitor `<HARASSER>`‘s Internet activity for threats
    
    
- deregister/block `<HARASSER>` from using this service
    
    
- provide me/law enforcement with identifying information about `<HARASSER>`‘s account
    
    
- assist me in referring `<HARASSER>`‘s actions to law enforcement
