# Reporting Harassment
    
    
People can be jerks.    
    
    
Sh*t can happen.    
    
    
PyLadies wants to provide a safe space for its members, so we’ve written this document to help those who experience harassment within the PyLadies community.

You are not obligated to report harassment that you’ve faced, or witnessed!     
    
    
But we hope to provide mediums in which you feel comfortable doing so.
