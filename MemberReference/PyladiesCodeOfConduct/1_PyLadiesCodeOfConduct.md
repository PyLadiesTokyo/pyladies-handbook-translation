# PyLadies Code of Conduct
    
    
All PyLadies events (Meetups, conference lunches, etc), online spaces (IRC, Facebook, etc) are beholden to the PyLadies [Code of Conduct Policy](http://kit.pyladies.com/en/latest/member/coc.html#coc).    
    
    
Every PyLadies location is required to make [Code of Conduct Policy](http://kit.pyladies.com/en/latest/member/coc.html#coc) public in some way.     
    
    
For instance, PyLadies SF has a dedicated [page](http://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesSF/pages/Code_Of_Conduct/) on their Meetup space.    
    
    
The `#pyladies` IRC channel on Freenode has a link to the main website’s Code of Conduct in the topic of the channel.    
    
    
If you can not find the following Code of Coduct posted somewhere (e.g. wherever they post events), please reach out to your locations’ organizers.
