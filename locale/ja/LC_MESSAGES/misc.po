"This document outlines the policy of PyLadies regarding the use of its "

"this policy."
msgstr ""

#: ../../misc/trademark.rst:11
msgid ""
"\"PyLadies\" is a registered trademark of the `Python Software "
"Foundation`_ (PSF). The PyLadies logos (in several variants) are use "
"trademarks of the PSF as well."
msgstr ""

#: ../../misc/trademark.rst:13
msgid ""
"All trademarks, even those that apply to open source software, must be "
"used according to certain legal requirements. If these requirements are "
"not met, the trademark may be endangered or lost. One of these "
"requirements is for the trademark owner (in this case, the PSF) to "
"maintain standards for using its trademarks, and to enforce acceptable "
"use of the trademarks by taking action against parties that violate those"
" standards."
msgstr ""

#: ../../misc/trademark.rst:15
msgid ""
"Trademark law is mainly a way to protect the public, rather than the "
"trademark holder. This means that uses of trademarks that confuse "
"consumers -- which in our case would include our developer and user "
"community, or anyone else who might be likely be involved with or support"
" PyLadies -- are not permitted under law. As the owner of the trademark, "
"the PSF must be sure the mark is used properly, so the community is not "
"confused. That is what the PSF means when it's said that an unpoliced "
"trademark may be endangered or lost. When the trademark no longer "
"represents a certain level of quality to the community, or no longer "
"indicates that the PSF are the source of the products that bear the "
"trademark, the trademark loses its value."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Underlying PSF's trademark policy is a set of guidelines for what is -- "
"and is not -- acceptable use of PSF's trademarks, specifically the word "
"mark \"PyLadies\", the PyLadies logos, and variations of those marks. "
"This policy describes the uses generally approved by PSF for its "
"trademarks. However, if you violate this policy, or otherwise take "
"actions that may compromise the goodwill or trademarks of PSF, or expose "
"PSF to liability, PSF may require you to cease all use of any PSF "
"trademark, regardless of the uses allowed in this policy."

"Any commercial use of the PyLadies trademarks in product or company names"
" must be approved first by PyLadies and/or the PSF. Some uses, like "

"Software\" or \"PyLadies IDE\" will be refused. This is because they are "

"Although many uses of PyLadies's trademarks are governed by more specific"

"guidelines apply to almost any use of PyLadies's trademarks."
msgstr ""

#: ../../misc/trademark.rst:51
msgid ""
"If the trademark is registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office,"
" it is referred to as a registered mark. The first or most prominent "
"mention of a PyLadies trademark should be immediately followed by a "
"symbol for registered trademark: \"®\" or \"(r)\". For example "
"\"PyLadies® ...\" This requirement is waived in all contexts where such "
"marks are not normally included: email, online discussion, non-graphical "
"advertisements (when permitted), and academic papers. We encourage the "
"use of the symbol whenever possible, but recognize that many non-"
"commercial and informal uses will omit it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../misc/trademark.rst:53
msgid ""
"The PyLadies logos are not currently registered. (We will post an update "
"to this policy if they are registered later.) These logos should be used "
"in the form provided by PyLadies, and should be accompanied by a symbol "
"for unregistered trademarks: \"(TM)\" or a small TM \"™\". This may not "
"be removed or obscured and must always be included with the logo."
msgstr ""

#: ../../misc/trademark.rst:55
msgid ""
"Try to give the word \"PyLadies\" distinctive graphic treatment wherever "
"possible. The trademark should be set apart from surrounding text by "
"using ALLCAPS, italics, emphasized or underlined fonts."
msgstr ""

#: ../../misc/trademark.rst:57
msgid ""
"If the word \"PyLadies\" or the PyLadies logos are used in certain "
"contexts, the following statement should accompany its use: \"PyLadies\" "

"PyLadies Software Foundation, used by ___________ with permission from "
"the Python Software Foundation."
msgstr ""

"For websites and documentation this can be on a \"legal statements\" "

msgstr ""

#: ../../misc/trademark.rst:61
msgid ""
"Always use any trademark as an adjective only, with a capitalized \"P\" "
"and capitalized \"L\". For instance, it is correct to refer to the "
"community as \"PyLadies community\" (adjective) but not pyladies (all "
"lowercase), Pyladies (lowercase \"L\"), pyLadies (lowercase \"P\"), or "
"\"the PyLadies\" (noun). Don't use the trademark as a verb (\"PyLadies "
